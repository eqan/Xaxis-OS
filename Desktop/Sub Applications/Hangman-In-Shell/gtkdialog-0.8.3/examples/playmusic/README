Installation
============

From Source
-----------
By default the application will run from the current folder but it is
possible to install it using the supplied Makefile (type "make" to show
usage examples).

Install to wherever your PREFIX is currently set to:

    make install

To uninstall:

    make uninstall

DESTDIR is supported for packagers to install to an intermediate folder;
for example:

    make DESTDIR=playmusic-0.1.8 install

Requirements
============

Gtkdialog >= 0.8.0 - http://code.google.com/p/gtkdialog/

Configuration
=============

PlayMusic's settings are stored within the rcfile ~/.playmusic/playmusicrc
which is automatically created on application start-up if not found to exist.
Within this file are several options that you can modify to better configure
PlayMusic for your particular system:

Section: Players
----------------
This section contains a list of players for some of the many different audio
file formats available plus a catch-all entry called "other" which you can use
to open anything that doesn't have an entry itself. The syntax of the entries
is format=player and you can remove or add anything you like to this section.
You could for example just have other=some_player if that's what you want.

The first time you run PlayMusic it will attempt to auto-configure the players
and it'll be looking for programs such as madplay, mpg123, mpg321, ogg123,
flac123, wavplay, aplay and playsound, but it's not [yet] a comprehensive list
of lightweight audio players so let me know if there's something I've missed.

Section: Options
----------------
This section contains several options which control PlayMusic's behaviour and
the majority of these are documented within the rcfile but there's one that's
worthy of a mention here and that is cover_search_pattern. This option is used
to select the image within each music folder to show as the cover art and by
default it looks for *.[JjPpBbGg][PpNnMmIi][GgPpFf] i.e. a jpg, png, bmp or gif
case insensitively with the first match found being chosen. You might need to
be a bit more selective here such as [Cc]over.jpg, AlbumArt_*_Large.jpg or
whatever is necessary (this pattern is passed to the ls command).

Execution
=========

Usage: playmusic [FILE or FOLDER]

A FILE creates a playlist of the folder non-recursively and plays the file.
A FOLDER creates a playlist of the folder recursively and plays the first file.
No arguments resumes playing the last playlist and the last file played.

A very effective way to use the application is to configure it to open folders
within your file manager by perhaps choosing it from a right-click menu. It'll
then create a playlist of the folder and everything within it recursively so
that you can play all the albums of one particular artist.

Operation
=========

Left-clicking the track details toggles between album/artist and track.

Left-clicking the cover navigates to the next folder if one exists.
Right-clicking the cover navigates to the previous folder if one exists.
Middle-clicking the cover will open the cover full-size in another window.
