Thunor: I've fixed these or found them to have already been fixed:
------------------------------------------------------------------
(1)  05.02-combo_input: the input is not working in comboboxes.
(2)  There is no gtk_combo_box support, we have only gtk_combo.
(3)  The edit is not producing value on the output.
(4)  06.01-editor_attributes: The edit does not handle the <default> attribute.
(5)  06.01-editor_attributes: Custom type properties, such as 
      "wrap-mode"            GtkWrapMode           : Read / Write
     are not supported. (Thunor: it already works as a tag attribute).
(6)  10.01-vbox_and_hbox_attributes: we always packing with the defaults.
(7)  Segfault if no name given for the frame.
(8)  All the action handling functions (button_pressed) should get a type
     parameter showing what kind of command has to be executed.
(10) The tree widget is virtually unhandled.
(12) Segmentation fault when the table has no variable name.

Thunor: These still remain:
---------------------------
(9)  Opening multiple window with the same name leads to confusion.
(11) At the creation of the widgets the initialization should be sorted
     as the dependencies are dictating.
(13) Unpaired " is printed to the standard output, which is very problematic.
